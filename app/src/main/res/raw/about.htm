	Hi, my name is Ivan Gurkin, I live in Ekaterinburg and I love freediving.
	I created this program especially for myself, as a variant convenient for me.
</p>
<p>
	First of all I would like to get rid of ads and get a tool for training breath with a friendly interface and alerts.
	At the head was put that the program will only be used on the phone, so you can just relax and train apnea.
</p>
<p>
	Format timers such that you have to first of all to overcome themselves.
	Even setting the record you will first have to overcome yourself, and then we will see what how much longer you can hold your breath than in previous times.
	I tried not to use color palette with sharp colors, it basically consists of pastel shades.
	First of all it is necessary to calm down, and only then the sports component.
</p>
<p>
	If the program you like, or be useful, I am very happy. As this project is open source - no financial contributions or advertising.
	It is planned to continue its development according to the needs.
	If you have any suggestions regarding functionality, interface, or improve the translation, it is possible to leave the application in the Issues section
	or write me an email.
