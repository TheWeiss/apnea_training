		Hi, my name is Ivan Gurkin, freediving and I enjoy living in Yekaterinburg.

		I created this program primarily for themselves, as an option convenient to me.

		First of all I would like to get rid of ads and get a tool for training breath with a friendly interface and alerts.
		At the head was put that the program will only be used on the phone,
		easy to use interface and the necessary notifications, so you can just relax and train the breath hold.

		If you like it, or was useful, I am very happy. So is it an open-source project - no financial contributions.
		It can be found at the link https://github.com/paradoxfm/apnea_training
		It is planned to continue its development according to the needs.
		If you have any suggestions regarding functionality, interface or improve the translation, it is possible to leave the application in the Issues section
		or write to me personally in the mail megazlonet@gmail.com.
