	<p>
		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">How
			well known, the main trigger level is to inhale
			carbon dioxide in the lungs. With breath-hold and increase
			the amount of carbon dioxide, our brain sends a signal
			respiratory system to breathe. Thus breath holding
			divided into 2 phases: phase comfort and phase of the struggle, when the brain
			actively sends signals to the respiratory system, and that begins
			answer that diaphragm contraction (contractions).</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Training
			is a series of respiratory delays aimed at
			the development of the organism tolerance to higher CO2 levels
			(Hypercapnia), increasing carbon dioxide levels during each
			following the delay. For this purpose, the delay time is breathing
			constant, and the time of rest between latency gradually decreases,
			thereby increasing the residual level of CO2 for each
			following the delay.</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Recommended
			select delay time between 50% and 80% of its maximum.
			The start time of rest for 2-3 minutes. Reduce the time interval
			rest 15-20 seconds.</font>

		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Series
			breathing delay, aimed at developing the body's tolerance
			to a decrease in oxygen level (hypoxia). This is achieved by a gradual
			increasing the duration of the delay of breath at the same time
			recreation. rest interval should be large enough to catch
			to get rid of excessive levels of CO2, accumulated after the delay, and
			recover. Delay interval large enough to receive
			hypoxic required load, i.e. by the end of the table
			delay must be close to maximum.</font>

	<p>
		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Remember
			that all independent training on respiratory arrest
			spending only on land! The first rule of freediving - never

		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">For
			convenience, we recommend that you use the clip to the nose, and
			Tracking and locking to acquire results
			oximeter. You can create a table in which to record important
			parameters such as heart rate, blood oxygen saturation
			oxygen, the starting time of contraction, and the maximum delay time
			etc. This will analyze your results, and see progress
			It will create an additional incentive for training.</font>

		<font face="Verdana, Tahoma, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">At
			breath at the time one of the important principles - not to think about
