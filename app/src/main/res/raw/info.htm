<h3><font color="#366799">Practice holding your breath. CO2 and O2 Tables</font></h3>
<p>
	Very often, people who have completed a training course freediving, ask how
	You can train your breath hold home away from the sea, in order to better prepare for the next trip and to not lose shape.
</p>
<p>
	Quite effective and popular among freedivers training, allowing
	significantly increase the length of breath, is a static delay training on CO2 and O2 tables. What is it and what does it do?
</p>
<h4><font color="#366799">Hypercapnia table CO2</font></h4>
<p>
	As is well known, the main trigger for inhalation is the level of carbon dioxide in the lungs. With breath-hold and increase
	the amount of carbon dioxide, our brain sends a signal to the respiratory system to breathe. Thus breath holding
	divided into 2 phases: phase comfort and phase of the struggle, when the brain sends signals to the active respiratory system, and she begins
	answer that diaphragm contraction (contractions).
</p>
<p>
	Training consists of a series of breathing delay, aimed at developing the body's tolerance to higher CO2 levels
	(Hypercapnia), increasing carbon dioxide levels during each subsequent delay. For this purpose, the delay time is breathing
	constant, and the time delays between the rest is gradually reduced, thereby increasing the residual level of CO2 for each subsequent delay.
</p>
<p>
	It is recommended to select the delay time between 50% and 80% of its maximum.
	The start time of rest for 2-3 minutes. The interval to reduce the time of rest for 15-20 seconds.
</p>

<h4><font color="#366799">Hypoxic table O2</font></h4>
<p>
	Series breathing delay, aimed at developing the body's tolerance to low oxygen levels (hypoxia). This is achieved by a gradual
	an increase in the duration of breath at the same time relaxing. rest interval should be large enough to catch
	to get rid of excessive levels of CO2, accumulated after the delay and recover. Delay interval large enough to receive
	hypoxic required load, i.e. delay the end of the table should be close to maximum.
</p>
<p>
	We remind that all the independent exercise on respiratory arrest
	spending only on land! The first rule of free diving - Never dive alone, refers including to the static breath hold.
</p>
<p>
	For convenience, we recommend that you use the clip for the nose, and to track and fix the results of purchase
	oximeter. You can create a table in which to record important parameters such as heart rate, blood oxygen saturation
	oxygen contractions start time, maximum delay time, etc. This will analyze your results, and see progress
	It will create an additional incentive for training.
</p>
<p>
	When you breath in the time of one of the important principles - not to think about time.
	Therefore, training tables is recommended to use special applications for your phone, which
	configure the necessary parameters of training, after which you are comfortable is located on the bed,
	put near the phone, and the app tells you all the instructions.

	Hi, my name is Ivan Gurkin, I live in Ekaterinburg and I love freediving.
	First of all I would like to get rid of ads and get a tool for training breath with a friendly interface and alerts.
	At the head was put that the program will only be used on the phone, so you can just relax and train apnea.
</p>
<p>
	Format timers such that you have to first of all to overcome themselves.
	Even setting the record you will first have to overcome yourself, and then we will see what how much longer you can hold your breath than in previous times.
	I tried not to use color palette with sharp colors, it basically consists of pastel shades.
	First of all it is necessary to calm down, and only then the sports component.
</p>
<p>
	If the program you like, or be useful, I am very happy. As this project is open source - no financial contributions or advertising.
	It is planned to continue its development according to the needs.
	If you have any suggestions regarding functionality, interface, or improve the translation, it is possible to leave the application in the Issues section
	or write me an email.
